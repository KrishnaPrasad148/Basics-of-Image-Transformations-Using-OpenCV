# Basics-of-Image-Transformations-Using-OpenCV

Aim
To perform image transformation such as Translation, Scaling, Shearing, Reflection, Rotation and Cropping using OpenCV and Python.

Software Required:
Anaconda - Python 3.7

Algorithm:
Step1:

Step2:

Step3:

Step4:

Step5:

Program:
Developed By:
Register Number:
i)Image Translation


ii) Image Scaling



iii)Image shearing



iv)Image Reflection




v)Image Rotation




vi)Image Cropping



Output:
i)Image Translation




ii) Image Scaling




iii)Image shearing




iv)Image Reflection




v)Image Rotation




vi)Image Cropping




Result:
Thus the different image transformations such as Translation, Scaling, Shearing, Reflection, Rotation and Cropping are done using OpenCV and python programming.
